# Part Time Project Guides and Guidelines

## Requirements
- Project must have at least 3 views
  - One of those views must be the About page with details about the project integrants and the project itself
- React router must be used in the project
- At least **one** API must be used in the project to get data. If the group decides to create its own data, it needs to be hosted in Github and consumed as an API.
- There needs to be at least one feature: Write at least one algorithm to manipulate data (as opposed to just getiting data and rendering it)
--------

## Process

### Development
1.- If the project will include an express server:
  - Create a folder and initialize a git repository.
  - Create a repository on Github, and link the local repository.
  - Add a README.md with a title and description of the project.

2.- Create Wireframes for the pages that are going to be in the project. All images will be placed in a folder inside the repository and linked in the README.md file.

3.- Break down development process into small actionable items and create a Github Issue with each one.

4.- Each student will pick an Issue from the list and checkout a git branch of the same name as the Issue.
**Do not work directly on the master branch**. For a short guide on how to work with Git/Github follow [THIS link](./git_process.md)

### Presentation
Each project will be presented on the last day of the cohort.
